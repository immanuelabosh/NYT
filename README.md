# NYT

11/10 - Complete up to week 5.

##### Note 
  - make a book class if necessary, by extending article (rename document?)
  - extract static function in fakeDatabase that fills it with articles
  - add more books to fakeBookDatabase
  - animations? crossfade when switching fragments - when opening detailed view animate image change
  - don't retain state when switching fragments (see [material.io](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation/#behavior))
  - **should main activity and app bar use fragment manager to add fragments? Nested fragments?**
