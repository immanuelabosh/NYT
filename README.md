Currently the baseline app for Week 2 INFS3634. 

You will need to know how everything in this app works to be able to continue in Week 3.

- Main activity shows two articles in a ConstraintLayout, in a ScrollView.
- The article layout is defined in a separate file ```article.xml```
- We use ```<include>``` to reuse the article layout in our main activity
